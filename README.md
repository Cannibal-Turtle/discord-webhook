# Discord Novel Arc Notifier

This project automatically checks RSS feeds for new novel arcs and sends formatted Discord notifications. It supports multiple novels with persistent arc history and NSFW detection (restricted by novel title). All messages use a global Discord webhook (set as a GitHub secret named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`).

## ðŸ“‚ User Setup Guide

### âœ… 1. Add a New Novel to Track
To add a new novel, update `config.json` with the following fields:

```json
{
  "novels": [
    {
      "novel_title": "Your Novel Title",
      "role_mention": "<@&DISCORD_ROLE_ID>",
      "free_feed": "https://your-free-feed-url.xml",
      "paid_feed": "https://your-paid-feed-url.xml",
      "novel_link": "https://your-novel-link/",
      "host": "Your Hosting Site",
      "custom_emoji": "<:EmojiID>",
      "discord_role_url": "https://discord.com/channels/YOUR_ROLE_URL",
      "history_file": "your_novel_history.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each novel must have a **unique `history_file`** to store its arc history.

## ðŸŽ¯ Notes
- If a novel has no history of previous arcs, then history must be inserted manually before it can pick up automatically from the RSS feed.
- Arcs are stored persistently and prevent duplicate notifications.
- NSFW detection adds an extra Discord role mention.
