# Discord Novel Arc Notifier

This project automatically checks RSS feeds for new novel arcs and sends formatted Discord notifications. It supports multiple novels with persistent arc history and NSFW detection (restricted by novel title). All messages use a global Discord webhook (set as a GitHub secret named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`).
